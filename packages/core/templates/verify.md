# VERIFY (READ-ONLY)

You are VERIFYING, not implementing. The `<inputs>` block names a plan and PRD (conventionally file paths). `Read` them.

**Make NO commits and NO source edits.** You may read files and run the test/type suites. The only file you may write is the report named at the end.

# RECONCILE

For each task in the plan, determine its true status from reality, not from checkboxes:

- Inspect recent `git log` (above) and the working tree. Code that is present and committed is **done** — even if the plan's checkbox is unticked. Treat checkboxes as hints, not truth.
- Cite evidence: the `file:line` or commit SHA that implements the task.

# RUN THE SUITES

Run the project's test and type checks read-only to confirm the implemented work is green. Use the repo's conventional commands (e.g. `pnpm -r test` / `pnpm -r typecheck`; `dotnet test` / `dotnet build`). Record pass/fail counts.

# CLASSIFY

Put every task in exactly one bucket:

- **DONE** — implemented, committed, evidence cited, suites green.
- **GAP** — not implemented, incomplete, or failing. Say what is missing.
- **DEFERRED** — intentionally not done in this environment (operational / needs prod creds / AFK-deferred). Say why.

# REPORT

Write your report to `.ralph-tmp/verify-report.md` using the `Write` tool (this path is gitignored scratch — it is the one write you may make). Structure it:

```
# Verify report

## Verdict

<one-line: all done / N gaps / N deferred>

## Done

- <task> — <evidence: file:line or commit>

## Gaps

- <task> — <what is missing>

## Deferred

- <task> — <why>

## Suites

- <command> — <pass/fail counts>
```

Also print the Verdict + section counts to your final message. Do not commit.
